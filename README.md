# NOT REAL RANSOMWARE
This is a quick N dirty electron app to fake ransomware. Some one at work thinks they can get away with a weak root password (that can be logged in to through ssh). That's not going to fly!

This app will throw a big borderless window across the entire screen, making it look like your computer has been hit by ransomware! Should give some one a little spook! >:)
